freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,Adding testing feature to bonfire,CLOSED,2015-01-18T07:59:04Z,True,False,2015-01-21T06:50:47Z,,0,1,1,4,4,"I have created an addition to the bonfire IDE that allows users to test any function within the main coding window.  Here are some pieces of its functionality:
- Identifies arguments and creates input boxes for each
- Side by side mode with editor
- Test suite execution displays percentage of tests correct, highlights passing tests green, failing tests red
- For failing tests, displays what the actual output was
- Users can delete tests once they are created

Here are some todos that still remain:
- Don't use the eval method to evaluate the test. Nate has the plugin, but it is currently only configured with the console output.  I need to make the test framework work as a callback from the plugin completing its execution.  This requires changing a large portion of Nate's code, so I held off on it.
- Allow other types of comparisons besides equality.  We can test behavior, type, length, features of a JSON object, almost anything with chai.

**Change 2:**
Also added the ""Related accounts"" parameter as per https://dev.twitter.com/web/intents

**To test:**
Unfollow FCC on Twitter, 
complete a challenge ,
Tweet about challenge completion

Expected result:
1) FreeCodeCamp Username in tweet
2) After tweeting opportunity to follow FCC account

- Identifies arguments and creates input boxes for each
- Side by side mode with editor
- Test suite execution displays percentage of tests correct, highlights passing tests green, failing tests red
- For failing tests, displays what the actual output was
- Users can delete tests once they are created

Here are some todos that still remain:
- Don't use the eval method to evaluate the test. Nate has the plugin, but it is currently only configured with the console output.  I need to make the test framework work as a callback from the plugin completing its execution.  This requires changing a large portion of Nate's code, so I held off on it.
- Allow other types of comparisons besides equality.  We can test behavior, type, length, features of a JSON object, almost anything with chai.

Unfollow FCC on Twitter, 
complete a challenge ,

> The eBook has an embedded table of contents, working cross-references, well-placed page breaks and tons of others tiny tweaks and enhancements. 

Both of these resources have been updated and enhanced and build upon the original work by Mark Pilgrim.

It should be said that I did not hotlink to the PDF but instead linked to the page where the PDF can be downloaded.
Mislav Marohnić, the person who prepared the PDF, made a great effort in doing so and he should be recognised for that. I think that the other PDF hotlinks should be substituted with links to the proper pages where the PDFs can be downloaded but I'll leave that up to others.
