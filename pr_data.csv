freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp,Adding testing feature to bonfire,CLOSED,2015-01-18T07:59:04Z,True,False,2015-01-21T06:50:47Z,,0,1,1,4,4,"I have created an addition to the bonfire IDE that allows users to test any function within the main coding window.  Here are some pieces of its functionality:
- Identifies arguments and creates input boxes for each
- Side by side mode with editor
- Test suite execution displays percentage of tests correct, highlights passing tests green, failing tests red
- For failing tests, displays what the actual output was
- Users can delete tests once they are created

Here are some todos that still remain:
- Don't use the eval method to evaluate the test. Nate has the plugin, but it is currently only configured with the console output.  I need to make the test framework work as a callback from the plugin completing its execution.  This requires changing a large portion of Nate's code, so I held off on it.
- Allow other types of comparisons besides equality.  We can test behavior, type, length, features of a JSON object, almost anything with chai.

**Change 2:**
Also added the ""Related accounts"" parameter as per https://dev.twitter.com/web/intents

**To test:**
Unfollow FCC on Twitter, 
complete a challenge ,
Tweet about challenge completion

Expected result:
1) FreeCodeCamp Username in tweet
2) After tweeting opportunity to follow FCC account

The user would just see ""/stories/google-1"" since it happens so fast but you can see it in the cli.

Since only 1 result should be returned anyway (`exports.returnIndividualStory`), I figured using findOne would be appropriate.

Quick question: What Is the reason for find using regex on the Story.find?:
 `Story.find({'storyLink' : new RegExp(storyName, 'i')}, function(err, story) {`

Going forward - reason seems to be that jquery's .css() returns the _computed_ value for colors - i.e. it's running the tests using rgb(255, 0, 0) instead of ""red"" or hex values. It's also very picky and does want the spaces after the commas - rgb(255,0,0) does not work. (The docs used to say that you can use strings/hex; they have since been corrected.)

http://api.jquery.com/css/#css1

The problem seems to be in the test. If you add the name trait to a checkbox then the challenge will pass. So to fix this I just changed the input type from a checkbox to a radio (which is what the instructions tell you to do it on) and I changed the attribute comparison from trait to personality (which is what the instructions tell you to name it).

I've tested this with console.log and my update works for me. Please review and let me know.

I was pretty much 100% about the edits in 77d4aff; I went ahead and changed 'in' to 'on' because it sounded better in my head and people in the chat seemed to agree.

In f8fa6ee I just added Gitter as an alternative to Slack because Gitter works closely with GitHub and I wasn't sure whether the non-profits use GitHub or not.

Since my Spanish is not what it should be, I only replaced the links, leaving a native Spanish speaker to reword the sentences in `seed/challenges/get-set-for-free-code-camp.json`.

Lastly, I found a JSON key on line 129 in `common/models/user.json` called `sentSlackInvite`. I'm not sure what this does, couldn't find a reference anywhere else, so I didn't dare to remove it.

Before (and if) you pull this I'd like to rebase it into a single commit, and, if someone explains the Spanish and `sentSlackInvite` parts, add those changes.

I'm not even sure what I was doing anymore, but I stumbled upon an unused CSS selector, decided to look for more, and found quite a few. I'm honsetly not sure if these are somehow used through some sort of magic, but I searched through the entire codebase and found no other references to them, so they should be safe to remove.

Other than remove unused selectors, I organized some of them, fixed the stylization of a few, replaced one, as well as replaced the ubiqitous `#eee` with the already existing `@gray-lighter` variable.

This should hopefully clear the CSS/LESS up a bit, but don't just trust me, get in there and read (specifically the `next-challenge-button` and `delay-half` parts, they confused me) ; I did my best to make sure I'm not deleting some classes, essential to FCC's design, but I'm not making any promises.
